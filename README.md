<!-- Things I do on my freetime -->
 
### Freetime
I am currently studying C# and JS, my goal is to create both videogames in the Unity game engine as well as productivity aplications for Windows. My profile displays the many projects I have developed on my freetime from basic utility applications to Discord bots.

### Collaboration and open source
Collaboration is an important aspect of programming as many perspectives can create unique and innovative solutions to problems. Open sourcing as well as forming teams as a good way to both improve as a developer and create amazing products.
